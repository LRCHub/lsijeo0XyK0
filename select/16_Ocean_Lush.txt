Come with me into a cool blue stream
Bleed into oceans green, lips open wide, drinking the tide

Reach for me, here where the ocean sea melts
And you sink with me deeper inside, I'll make you mine

Take me down, down where their voices drown
Down where the only sound echoes for me

Take me down, down where their voices drown
Down where the only sound echoes for me

Floating away under the waves
Kiss me again, you'll tell me when salt on my lips
Cool fingertips under the sea, stay here with me
